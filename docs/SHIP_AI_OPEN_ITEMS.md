This file ranks what is still open in the ship-AI and AI-command lane, as
docs/GUNNERY_OPEN_ITEMS.md section 31 does for gunnery and docs/LUA_BINDING_MISSION.md does for the
Lua natives. Each later section is one packet taken from the ranking.

## 1. The first ranking (packet `cc9_ship_ai_open_ranking_1`, cc9-ships7, 2026-09-28)

**Source.** The nine reference i logs `local\rb9_{bsm01,e2,jm06,jm08,lomp06,usn01,usn02,usn04,usn13}.log`
in worktree cc9-gunnery7. They were built at main `d466d4250` (docs/GAME_EXECUTABLE.md "2026-09-28 i").
- `local\ships7_census.py` (this worktree) sums every non-concrete host row with calls over the nine
  logs. `rows <regex>` prints each row's calls per mission.
- `local\ships7_sites.py` prints the comment block and the answer at each row's record site in
  `src/`.

**Reference i is older than main.** 114 commits separate `d466d4250` from this branch's base
`79b055574`. Five lane switches were flipped ON after i:
- `kShipAiSubAttackSelectBound` and `kShipAiSubAttackStatesBound` (docs/SHIP_AI_SUB_ATTACK.md 9). The
  submarines no longer run `attackmove`, so the `ShipAiState::attack_subject_00779aa0` row is gone.
- `kCautiousRouteBound` and `kCautiousWedgeBound` (docs/AI_CAUTIOUS_ROUTE.md 9, 14, 17).
- `kAiGroupSeedPerEntityBound` (docs/AI_CAUTIOUS_ROUTE.md 19). Every mission's AI grouping moved, so
  the group-shaped rows below (ranks 5, 6, 8 and 10) need re-counting on reference j.

Where a flip could move a count, the table cites a newer log as well. The two sub-attack ON logs are
`local\s5_on_{jm06,lomp06}.log` in worktree cc9-ships5 (commit `1f39b05db`).

**Reach**, as in docs/GUNNERY_OPEN_ITEMS.md section 16:
- 4 decides who is shot at, or a death.
- 3 decides an order or a ship's movement.
- 2 is a count or a score.
- 1 is presentation.

"Differs" says whether the host's answer differs from the image's on the measured rows.

| rank | item | image | image read | host file and label | calls (i) | differs | reach, in one line |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **a surface ship attacking a submarine** | the altitude gate `00852860` at `009E873B`; the sub-states it opens are lead pursuit `009E26C0` (`state+14CCh`) and tangent `009F3670` (`state+14E0h`) | gate complete (`00852860-008528AC`, `ship_ai_attackmove_altitude_gate_00852860`); both steps projected (`src/ship_ai_attackmove_substates.cpp`) | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiAttack::call_00852860` answers false. The two steps are the records `ShipAiAttack::lead_pursuit_step` and `tangent_step` | 1014 (JM06 994, LOMP06 20); 852 / 20 with sub attack ON | yes, whenever the target submarine is below a third of `[+1200h]+[+1204h]` | 3, and 4 if the pursuit is what puts escorts over a submerged boat. The label reads "no producer for +1200h / +1204h, unreachable, no kind-8 target". Both halves are false: JM06 reaches it 852 times, and those words are the dive bands the host holds since SUBMARINE_MODEL 12 (`GameUnitsHost::submarine_band_y`, `73f4f884c`) |
| 2 | **the follower's station point** | `009DF2D0`: the zone set `vtable[218h]` at `009DF41A`, the push `00417B10` at `009DF432` / `009DF4C5`, the leader yaw rate `00811940` at `009DF607` | `00417B10` complete (`avoid_zone_group_offset_00417b10`, bound for the ring probe as `GameAvoidZoneRuntime::offset`); `00811940` reconstructed (`GameUnitsHost::unit_current_yaw_rate_00811940`); `vtable[218h]` = `006DFD90`, which the ring probe binds as `zones.group_for_layer` | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp` `FollowFormationPointBinding`: `zone_set_218` answers 0, `push_out_of_zones` returns the point, `leader_yaw_rate` answers 0 | push 105916, yaw rate 52958, zone set 52958, on all nine rows | yaw rate: yes, whenever a leader turns. Push: only near a zone, and JM06's ring probe moved no start (`moved_starts=0`) | 3: the speed blend `009DF5E4..009DF65B` takes the leader's current yaw rate, so a follower of a turning leader keeps too much speed. The push label ("the body is unread") is stale |
| 3 | the free-bearing query | `009DC2E0` (`009DC2E0-009DCEA2`), at `009DF0FA` (the arm final step) and `009EC0C1` (the sector scan) | early outs only (docs/SHIP_NEIGHBOUR_AVOIDANCE.md 6). About 300 pseudocode lines are unread | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiArmFinal::free_bearing_009dc2e0` and `ShipAiSectorScan::free_bearing_009dc2e0` answer false | 450328. Zone rows: JM06 42457, LOMP06 18410, USN01 10438, USN13 6172, BSM01 6069, JM08 2886. No-zone rows (exact by the early out): E2 161339, USN02 122021, USN04 80536 | only for a ship with avoid-zone segments inside its query box; how often that happens is not counted | 3: it replaces `blk+324h`, the heading target, near land. A binding needs the runtime's segment search (`refresh_search`, `search_segment`, `search_arc`). It is the largest read here |
| 4 | the AI command's avoid-zone point | `00417B10` from the command tick (`ai_command_tick.cpp`) | complete, as rank 2 | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiCommand::avoid_zone_offset_point` returns the requested point. Label "contract: unread", stale | 1193 (USN13 517, E2 255, JM08 160, BSM01 104, USN04 78, USN01 74) | only for a point inside a zone | 3: the destination the AI command orders. It fits in rank 2's packet as the same routine and runtime |
| 5 | the party brain's replan flag | `00A15970`, from `00A182C0`: outside modes 4 to 7 it returns the OR of `brain+0h..+0Ch` `vtable[30h]()` (`00A159E8..00A15A6A`). For those four planners that is `00A18480`, which reads and clears the replan byte `planner+2Ch` (docs/AI_PLANNERS.md). The claim sets that byte | complete (listing read here) | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiGroups::brain_wants_immediate_think` answers false. Its comment reads only the mode 4 to 7 arms and says no planner sets a replan request; `planner_claim_group` sets no flag | 38491 (E2 8999, USN02 8999, USN04 4499, the others 2999 or 999) | yes, once after each planner claim: 1 to 3 claims per row (`ai parties claims=`) | 3: in the image a claim makes the party think again on the next call instead of 3 to 5 s later, so the first orders come earlier. Cheap: a flag set at the claim and cleared by the query. Where the claim sets `+2Ch` must be quoted from `00A22750` first |
| 6 | the group's area key | `0070E450` (`0070E450-0070E4B2`) at `009DE5B0` and `009ECA20` | unread (98 bytes) | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiArmFinal::group_area_key_0070e450` answers the leader's own travel layer, so the "moved" searcher is never chosen | 31576 (E2 8938, USN02 6858, USN01 4470, USN04 4438, JM06 3000, USN13 2886, LOMP06 986) | only for a group whose members sit on different travel layers. Per-entity seeding changes every group, so recount | 3: the path search's layer |
| 7 | the heading wrap after a heading store | `00605070` with ECX = `&blk+1D8h` at `009DFF81`, `009E00FA`, and the setter `009DFFB0`; `&brain+1E0h` at `009F3360` | complete (`BSP_Math_WrapAngleInPlace_Provisional`, `ship_ai_firepower_wrap_angle_00605070`) | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiControls::after_heading_stored` and `ShipAiApproach::wrap_brain_heading` record and do not wrap. `include/bsp/ship_ai_state_steps.hpp` still says "Body unread" | 154026 (USN13 93957, JM08 27233, BSM01 16734, USN02 7720, USN01 5700); 34126 for the approach | unknown: yes only if a heading outside (-pi, pi] is stored and a reader compares it unwrapped | 0 to 3. The binding is a one-line change; its value depends on a census of `blk+1D8h`'s readers, which was not done |
| 8 | the party brain's engagement pass | `00A179E0` (`00A179E0-00A18195`), from `BSP_AiPartyBrain_Think` | unread | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiParties::party_brain_plan_tail` records | 491, on all nine rows | unknown | unknown, possibly 3. It builds a vector from `brain+20h` (`008EA0C0`) and snapshots the group lists. Whether it issues orders is not established |
| 9 | the close attack's busy member | `[member+538h]->vtable[2Ch]` at `00A1443D`, in `00A13B60` | unread | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiCommand::close_controller_busy` answers false | 5991 (BSM01 1500, USN02 1315, JM08 782, JM06 672) | unknown | 3: a busy member is not served by the close-attack pass. The same slot decides the Cargo capture weight (3.0 or 0 in `capture_weight_00a03510`) |
| 10 | the planner candidate's base weight | `00A0F970` | unread | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiPlanners::candidate_base_weight` weighs by member count | 451 (E2 139, USN02 111, USN04 107, JM06 72, LOMP06 22) | likely | 3: which group the planner picks. Recount after per-entity seeding |
| 11 | BigLandingShip | `class+808h` at `00827F95` (the neighbour admission `00827F70`) and in `00A03510` | the byte's readers are read | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiNeighbour::big_landing_ship_808` answers 0. `game_hosts_ai.cpp` takes the capture weight's 0.1 arm | 6331 (BSM01 4289, JM08 2042) | yes for four classes: this installation's `vehicleclasses.lua` (mtime 2026-05-09, locally modified) sets `BigLandingShip` true on the LSM (class 12), the US LST (41), the IJN LST (91) and the strafeable US LST (345) | 3 when an enemy submarine is near one of those hulls (the admission skips it), and 3 in capture scoring (1.0 against 0.1) |
| 12 | the approach frame state's unread spans | `009F1BC0`: `009F1DBF-009F1E16`, `009F2124-009F2216`, `009F221C-009F237B`, `009F2395-009F26EC`, `009F270A-009F3083`, with the approach-point stores at `009F2216`, `009F237D`, `009F23B5` and `009F26F0` | partial (docs/SHIP_AI_APPROACH_UPDATE.md, routine table) | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiApproach::frame_state_unread_spans` | 34126 (USN02 29287, JM06 4603, LOMP06 236) | not on USN02's mode 0 (docs/ATTACKMOVE_ENGAGEMENT_RANGE.md 1 finds the host's standoff equal to the image's). Possibly for modes 1, 3 and 4 | 3 for a submarine target (mode 1) or a landing ship at a command building (modes 3 and 4). It follows rank 1 |
| 13 | the carrier arm of the squadron exclusion | `009FFEB0` | the `00E17BF2` test only; the carrier arm is unread | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `AiCommand::squadron_excluded_009ffeb0` answers `007EDA90`'s false | 13039, on all nine rows | unknown | 3 for a carrier's squadrons in an AI group. It borders the plane lane |
| 14 | the clearance's path fade | `00778890` and the identity test against `00E08F80` (`moveonpath`), at `009F0000` / `009F0019` | `00778890` complete (`ship_ai_unit_group_leads_00778890`) | `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp`: `ShipAiClearance::path_fade_00778890` answers false. Its label, "neither has a producer here", no longer holds for `moveonpath`, which the host now runs (`kPilotMoveOnPathBound`, the cautious route) | 24310, on all nine rows | only for a group leader on `moveonpath` | 3: the clearance distance |
| 15 | the navigator's avoidance receivers | `00835640` over `0071C1E0` (`00721A93`'s 5Ah arm); the setters `009DABB0` (torpedo) and `009DABD0` (land) | the route is read; the setters have no caller | `game_hosts_script_orders.cpp`: `Navigator::avoidance_receiver_torpedo` and `_land` | 142 / 130 (USN13 52, USN02 28) | yes: the host never stores the Lua request in `blk+3ECh` | 3, on few calls |
| 16 | a director `stop` and the command begin | `009E1170` (`stop` reaches the cruise arm and latches nothing), `00835C70` at `vtable[78h]` | the `stop` state family is unreconstructed; `00835C70` is run at its own site | `game_hosts_commands.cpp` `CruiseCommand::stop_state_step`; `game_hosts_ship_ai.cpp` `CommandController::begin_command` | 1117 / 1427 | unknown | 3: what a `stop` asks of the ship |
| 17 | the follow request's OwnerPlayer arm | `00779DB4`, `entity+188h` | read | `game_hosts_ai.cpp`: `owner_player_known = false`, so the arm is skipped | follow requests: 36 to 2550 per row, joins 1 to 23 | can only admit a follow the image refuses, between differently owned ships | 3, and rare: docs/AI_CAUTIOUS_ROUTE.md 15 finds USN12's refusals are the image's own |

**Exact or closed, kept off the ranking:**

| row or item | calls (i) | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ShipAiEngageGate::armament_readiness` `009E85CD` | 8548 | exact for every class on these rows except the Kaiten and the Kamikaze Boat (docs/ATTACKMOVE_ENGAGEMENT_RANGE.md 4 and 5.3) |
| `ShipAiApproach::zone_allows_target_00864680` | 26649 | the gunnery host's line-of-sight substitution, kept identical here; it belongs to gunnery |
| `ShipAiTorpedoStandoff::torpedo_bot_accuracy_008fb530` | 17454 | answers the robots.lua table (docs/GUNNERY_OPEN_ITEMS.md 31) |
| `ShipAiOrder::slot_to_order_ring`, `ShipAi::unit_weapon_director`, `ShipAi::drive_heading_vtable50` | 1014678 each | structure. The published triple has twelve readers and none steers (docs/UNIT_AI_ORDER_SLOT_READER.md) |
| `EntityOrder::route_message`, `Session::dispatch_*` | 7545 / 8553 | the local loopback of the session route. The order is applied |
| `ShipAiMoveOnPath::brain_leg_scale_0308`, `ShipAiApproach::set_brain_throttle_0258`, `ShipAiGoal::observer_*` | 5752 / 34126 / 327 | stores with no reader found in the recovered chain (the host comments at each site); not proved absent |
| `ShipAiNavBlock::seed_steering_unprojected` | 273 | the site's comment: only `blk+3C4h..+3E4h` of `009DFCB0` is projected, and the constructor overwrites all of it except `+3DCh` and `+3E0h`. Not re-checked here |
| `EntityCommandArm::path_interface` `007AC9D0` | 104 | answers "no path interface", which is the ship case |
| `AiParties::group_has_member_in_world_set` `00A2C450` | 13 | exact while `Objectives_Add` is unimplemented (the Lua lane) |
| the capture range stand-in (500) | | closed: `kCaptureAccessorsBound` reads `+7A0h` (docs/PLANNER_TASK_CHOICE.md 14). The comment at `game_hosts_ai.cpp` `kCaptureRangeStandIn` still reads as if open |
| the submarine's `attackmove` (`00779AA0`, brain+AB4h) | 44 | closed, ON (docs/SHIP_AI_SUB_ATTACK.md 9) |
| the player's ships in Montpelier's group | | closed, ON (docs/AI_CAUTIOUS_ROUTE.md 19) |
| the cautious route, the wedge, RETREAT, USN12's follow refusals | | closed (docs/AI_CAUTIOUS_ROUTE.md 9, 14 to 17) |
| the order ring's replace, the generated ship and squadron brains, the probe length | | closed, ON (docs/ORDER_RING_REPLACE.md 5, docs/GENERATED_SHIP_AI.md 5 to 7) |
| the attack-move standoff range | | closed: the host holds the image's standoff (docs/ATTACKMOVE_ENGAGEMENT_RANGE.md 1) |
| the torpedo evasion | | closed: the host evades as the image does (docs/TORPEDO_EVASION.md, USN02 2026-09-27) |
| the ship turn rate | | closed within 5%. Its residual is the category-5 gameplay modifiers `008E6430`, which no single-player registration is known to set (docs/SHIP_TURN_RATE.md) |
| the player's scripted helm | | a tool, not an image item (docs/SCRIPTED_HELM.md 9). USN02's primary 2 fails on the phase-2 enemy's gunfire |

**Not ranked, and why:**
- `ShipMotion::*` and `UnitMotion::*` rows are in the units host, which cc9-lua6 holds.
- `Unit::device_requests_release`, `can_release` and `slot_byte_9c0` are the plane lane's.
- `UnitInstance::smooth_intensity` and `wake_setting` are presentation.
- The planner quick-spawn `00A2B400` is a units-host creation, like every host quick-spawn.

**Labels that no longer hold:**
- Rank 1: "no producer" and "unreachable" for `00852860`.
- Rank 2: "the body is unread" for `00417B10`.
- Rank 4: "contract: unread" for the same routine.
- Rank 5: "no planner in this process sets a replan request", on `00A15970`.
- Rank 7: "Body unread" for `00605070`, in `include/bsp/ship_ai_state_steps.hpp`.
- Rank 14: "neither has a producer here".
- The capture range comment in the closed table.

**Next packet: rank 1, `cc9_submarine_target_substates`.**
- **Read** `009E873B..009E876C` again with the gate's inputs. The gate's inputs are the target's
  world Y (`+100h`) and the bands `[+1200h]`, `[+1204h]`. Confirm that these are bands 0 and 1 of
  `submarine_band_y`, and find the attackers on JM06 with their targets' depth levels.
- **Read** the host calls of `009E26C0` and `009F3670`, and what `brain+0B28h` holds when the gate
  opens.
- **Bind** the gate and the two steps OFF, with predictions on JM06 3200/3000 and LOMP06 1200/1000.
  Expect identity on USN01, USN02, USN04 and USN13, which have no submarine.
